<h2>Voice over SOS</h2>

Safety is one of the major concerns these days. This product empowers women to protect themselves against different types of safety threats in public and private spaces.

The major flaw with the major SOS applications in the market today is currently that all of them are based on activation using the press of a button, which in cases of distress can be a lot to ask from the person in crisis. With this application, we wish to solve this problem using a Voice activated SOS application that activates with a custom Voice Line. In addition to this, the website also provide women with self defence techniques and ways to fight away any person with malicious intent.
